# SyncPDF
A test for make synchronization to PDFs between mobile and computer, that means any edits on the PDF (add comment, add highlighting, etc.) will be appeares on both mobile and computer by simple push and pull commands.

I'll use a sample pdf which I download from https://file-example.com. Also I'll use Termux to use git on the Android device - which is a free and open source terminal emulator for Android.
